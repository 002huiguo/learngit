I learnt git two years ago, used the tutorial of liao. But that time ,I knows little about what i learnt, i only typed the commands according to the tutorial...when problems occured, then gave up or followed the tutorial step by step cautiously,was firghted to make a mistake. consequently, i quit before tag. 
But, today, I want to become more patient and concentrated, i will do my best tosolve every problem, and make progress.
Finally, thanks for Liao, your kinds of tutorials have become part of my learning schedual .
sincerely.
